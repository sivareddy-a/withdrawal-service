### Summary:

Design and implement a Service with an API (including data model and the backing implementation) with following functional requirements:

- User can send money from their account to another users account
- User can send money from their account to an external withdrawal address through an API (API Stub is provided)
- User can see operation progress

### Requirements:

- Written in Java, Kotlin, or Scala using Java Runtime version 17+ (We’re using Java in our projects)
- Has a remote protocol API, implementing a widely used specification (such as REST, gRPC, AMQP, Aeron UDP, etc..)
- Assume the API is invoked by multiple systems and services in the same time on behalf of end users.
- Datastore runs in memory for the sake of simplicity
- Runs standalone and doesn't require external pre-installed dependencies like docker
- Use well-known build manager like gradle or maven

### Goals:

- To demonstrate high quality code and solution design (As if you’re writing code for you current company)
- To demonstrate ability to produce solution without detailed requirements
- To demonstrate the API and functional requirements are working correctly
- Solution should be close to reality
- You can use any framework or library, but you must keep solution simple and straight to the point (hint: we’re not using Spring)

### Non-goals:

- Not to show ability to use frameworks - The goal of the task is to show fundamentals, not framework knowledge
- No need to implement non-functional pieces, like authentication, monitoring, or logging

Please upload solution to the Github, Bitbucket or Gitlab

### Withdrawal API stub (Must be used as is and not be modified in any way, with exceptions to T ):
